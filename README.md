# Classification Problem Tiny ImageNet

ImageNet is a big dataset of 200 classes. In this repository I have made two models on it by applying different different techniques into both of these and accuracy.

For Data file : 
.. code:: python

    python  utils.py
    
For Both model functions file : 
.. code:: python

    python model.py
    
For Model_1 file: 
.. code:: python

    python Model_1.ipynb
    
For Model_2 file:
.. code:: python

    python Model_2.ipynb
    
For Results of both model:
.. code:: python

    python Results.ipynb
